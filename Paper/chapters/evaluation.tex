\chapter{Evaluation}

In this chapter, we will evaluate the strategies through performance
measurements and discuss advantages, disadvantages and possible use cases.

\section{Benchmarks}

Performance measurements were taken for each strategy as well as for naive
reference implementations and are presented in cycles per byte (c/B) as well as
constant throughput in MiB/s of the entire encryption strategy.

The AArch64 defines system registers in addition to general-purpose registers
which are used for system configuration and monitoring. One of these registers
is the performance monitor cycle count register \texttt{PMCCNTR} which counts
processor clock cycles. Access from userspace is disabled by default and can be
activated through a custom Linux kernel module by setting \texttt{PMUSERENR.EN}
to 1. To minimize interference and because the cycle count register is
core-local, we isolate one of the cores from the rest of the system for
exclusive benchmarking use.
